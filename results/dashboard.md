# Dashboard Storytelling – Global Weather Insights (2023–2024)

This dashboard provides a comparative analysis of historical weather patterns across major global cities between 2023 and 2024, using hourly climate data sourced from Open-Meteo and processed through a custom ETL pipeline.

The objective is to identify climate trends, seasonal behavior, and city-level variability that may influence operational planning, urban resilience strategies, or data-driven decision making in weather-sensitive contexts.

## Key Perspectives

### Global Overview
- The KPI cards summarize overall climate conditions, highlighting average temperature, humidity, total precipitation, and data volume, offering an immediate snapshot of the dataset’s scope and intensity.

### Precipitation by City
- Total accumulated precipitation reveals significant differences between cities, emphasizing how geographic and climatic factors drive rainfall concentration. Cities such as Tokyo and New York exhibit notably higher precipitation volumes compared to European and African counterparts.

### Seasonal Temperature Patterns
- Average temperature by season shows a clear cyclical behavior, with summer presenting the highest temperatures and winter the lowest, validating expected seasonal dynamics across the analyzed locations.

### Temporal & Spatial Variability
- Filters by year and city allow users to explore how weather conditions evolve over time and differ geographically, enabling focused comparisons and localized insights.

## Analytical Insight

One notable finding is the temperature variability across cities, where some locations experience a much wider temperature range throughout the period. This variability is more critical than absolute temperature values, as it directly impacts infrastructure stress, energy demand, and environmental planning.

## Purpose & Use Case

- This dashboard is designed to:
* Support exploratory climate analysis
* Enable comparative city-level insights
* Serve as a foundation for further predictive or risk-based models

- The focus is not only on observing weather metrics, but on understanding patterns, variability, and trends that matter for decision-makers.
